# GroundDocs Cli

GroundDocs is a version-aware documentation assistant. It connects LLMs to trusted, real-time docs—reducing hallucinations and ensuring accurate, version-specific responses.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
npx @grounddocs/cli@latest install <client>
```

**Supported clients:** cursor, windsurf, cline, claude, witsy, enconvo, vscode


## 🔧 Manual Setup

To manually configure GroundDocs, add it to your IDE’s MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@grounddocs/grounddocs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@grounddocs/grounddocs@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
After configuration, restart your IDE for the changes to take effect.
